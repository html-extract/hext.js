Hext is a domain-specific language for extracting structured data from HTML. It can be thought of as a counterpart to templates, which are typically used by web developers to structure content on the web.

Note: This package is a JavaScript/WebAssembly port of Hext. Hext is also available as a native node addon: npm install hext
